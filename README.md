🧠 ChatGPT FAQ Assistant (Gemini + LangChain)
📌 Overview

This project is an AI-powered FAQ chatbot built using LangChain, Google Gemini (Generative AI), and FAISS for semantic search.
It loads data from a CSV file (e.g., company FAQs), converts them into embeddings, and lets users ask natural-language questions to get accurate, context-based answers — just like ChatGPT trained on your own data!
